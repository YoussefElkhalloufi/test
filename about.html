            <h1>THE WEEKND</h1>
            <h4>The Weeknd, byname of Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, 
                (born February 16, 1990, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), 
                Canadian rhythm-and-blues singer and songwriter who was 
                perhaps best known for his explicit songs about sex and drugs, 
                many of which were autobiographical, and for his soaring falsetto 
                and its singular tremolo.</h4>
            <h4>Tesfaye's mother and grandmother immigrated in the 1980s to Canada
                 from Ethiopia, and his first language was Amharic. When he was in 
                 grade 11, he quit school and left home, devoting himself to unbridled 
                 partying. Tesfaye eventually landed a job at American Apparel and at 
                 the same time began writing songs about drug use, casual sex, and alienation.
                  He crossed paths with musician and producer Jeremy Rose, and they 
                  started working together. Their collaboration yielded three atmospheric 
                  songs—“The Morning,” “Loft Music,” and “What You Need”—with lyrics that
                   were partly sung and partly rapped. The songs, credited to The Weeknd,
                    were uploaded as audio files to the video-sharing Web site YouTube 
                    in late 2010; their popularity grew exponentially after they were 
                    posted to the blog of Canadian rapper Drake.</h4>
